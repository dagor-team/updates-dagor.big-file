He was taken to Middle-earth at the bidding of Alatar, another Istar who took him as a friend. Pallando and Alatar (known as the Blue Wizards for their sea-blue robes) traveled to the east of Middle-earth with Curumo (Saruman the White) to aid some men and subdue others, primarily the Easterlings and Southrons who worshiped Sauron, and whose numbers were steadily increasing. Saruman later returned to the West, but Pallando along with Alatar stayed behind. Other than this, not much is positively known about Pallando or Alatar, but it is thought that Pallando most likely failed his mission eventually. However, in Tolkien's later years he provided an alternate name for the wizard, RÛmest·mo, meaning "helper of the East". Here it is thought that rather than fail his mission altogether, Pallando perhaps had the opposite fate, and he and Alatar may have in fact played some crucial role in the War of the Ring and in the victory of the Army of the West, unnoticed but significant."

To the 3 Hobbits, Gildor and the Elves appeared to shimmer as they walked through the night. The starlight glimmered in their hair and eyes. They camped in a clearing in the Woody End near Woodhall and the elves provided the Hobbits with bread and fruit and a fragrant drink. Frodo stayed up late talking to Gildor. They talked of the many dangers that the Hobbits might soon face. Frodo had greeted Gildor by saying, "Elen sÌla l˙menn' omentielvo" (A star shines upon the hour of our meeting) impressed with his knowledge of the ancient tongue and lore he commended Frodo and named him Elf-friend. Gildor perceived that the Enemy was seeking for Frodo, though he did not know why. He was reluctant to give Frodo any advice in Gandalf's absence."

For hundreds of years, she resided there making a labyrinth of webs within a network of caves to better trap her prey, which included all creatures great and small.

The Great Goblin was a Goblin chieftain of the Misty Mountains. He was a very large creature with a huge head. He was the chief of a group of goblins who lived in Goblin-town near the High Pass. They preyed on travellers who used another, easier pass near the main gate of Goblin-town until people started avoiding that route over the mountains. The goblins then made another gate that opened into a cave that they called the Front Porch, at the top of the High Pass. The Great Goblin also sometimes ordered his goblins to catch fish for him in Gollum's Lake, and these goblins were sometimes killed by Gollum."

It was to him that Glorfindel stated his prophecy that "not by the hand of men shall he fall" referring to the Witch-king as he fled from defeat. After becoming King in TA 2043, he was challenged by the Witch-king of Angmar, chief of the Ringwraiths, who then resided in Minas Morgul. E‰rnur, being quick to anger and wrath, would have accepted his challenge had the wise Steward Mardil VoronwÎ not held him back, and so the first challenge went unanswered. In TA 2050 a second challenge came, mocking E‰rnur, and Mardil was not able to stop E‰rnur from accepting the challenge.

After that, wolves were about to eat him, when a man, who turned out to be Gulz·r, killed them and saved him.  Atauko was brought to Carn-D˚m, where he was given the name D˚rmarth by the High Sorcerer of Angmar. From then and onwards, he could not think of anything but his hatred for Arthedain. D˚rmarth became a loyal follower of the Iron Crown, learning to tame Wolves and Trolls (losing his left ring finger in the process). He swore to protect the man who had saved him, and after a while, he ended up becoming the Captain of the Shadow Guard of the Witch-King himself."

When the Valar decided to send the order of the Istari (also known as Wizards) to Middle-earth, to counsel and assist all those in Middle-earth who opposed the Dark Lord Sauron, ManwÎ and Varda decided to include OlÛrin among the 5 who were sent. At first, OlÛrin was nervous and described himself as too weak and too afraid of Sauron. ManwÎ understood, and told him that that was one main reason why he should go, to overcome that fear. Thus, he insisted that OlÛrin should go as the third, but Varda convinced him not to include OlÛrin as the third, but as the second. OlÛrin agreed, and prepared for his departure from the Undying Lands with the other 4 wizards."

Before his fall, he was the chief of both the wizards and of the White Council (a league of all those opposed to Sauron). His knowledge and skill, especially of Sauron's devices, was said to be great.

Elladan and Elrohir were born in TA 130, and they have a younger sister, Arwen. Through their mother CelebrÌan, they are the only grandsons of Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn of LothlÛrien. In TA 2509, the brothers rescued their mother from her imprisonment with the Orcs. Although she was physically healed by Elrond, after fear and torment from the Orcs she lost all joy from Middle-earth, and so she departed for the Grey Havens the next year. Due to this, the twins harbored great hatred for Orcs. By the year TA 2933, Elladan and Elrohir went riding against Orcs with Arathorn II, the father of Aragorn. There Arathorn was slain and his wife and son went to dwell in Imladris, where Elrond received Aragorn as his foster-son, naming him Estel."

"Recruit the captain of the pirates \n \n Lore: \n Castamir the Usurper usurped the throne of Gondor from Eldacar, ruling from TA 1437 to 1447 of the Third Age, until he was violently deposed at the Battle of Erui. The great-grandson of the unremarkable King Calmacil, Castamir was not in line for the throne, but his royal background had made him the Lord of Ships under the previous king, Valacar. His lineage and influence left him in a position to challenge the current king, Eldacar, who was only half D˙nedain. As King Valacar's only son, Eldacar was the legitimate heir to the throne, but his half Rhovanion lineage angered citizens who believed in a pure d˙nedain royalty. Capitalizing on what became outright protest against the current king, Castamir was able to incite rebellion and besiege Eldacar within the city Osgiliath in TA 1437 of the Third Age. The city was set on fire by Castamir's troops, destroying the famed Dome of Stars. Shortly thereafter, Eldacar fled the city and into exile in Rhovanion, to the north. With the defeat of the king, Castamir seized the throne."

In the Second Age, he was defeated in the War of the Last Alliance by the last line of defense: Elves and Men under kings Gil-galad and Elendil. During that battle, Isildur managed to cut off Sauron's finger with the Ring on it, causing the destruction of his corporeal form and scattering his armies. After spending hundreds of years lying dormant and slowly regaining his strength, Sauron returned to power in the Third Age, but was finally defeated in the War of the Ring through the destruction of the One Ring by Frodo Baggins.

He became the leader of the Goblins of Moria and initiated the War of the Dwarves and Orcs in TA 2790 by beheading King ThrÛr, who had come to revisit the ruins of the ancient dwarven kingdom of Moria. At some point he had a son named Bolg. In the following years, Azog was the common enemy of all dwarves, and the war he started had its climax in the Battle of Azanulbizar, where he killed N·in, only to be himself slain by N·in's son D·in, who would later become King of Durin's Folk. His son, Bolg, inherited the reign in Moria and continued it for decades until his death at the Battle of the 5 Armies."

After his father's death, D˚rmarth and his mother moved with his uncle, who was abusive to them. After a while, he ended up killing his uncle and he had to flee, his mother getting killed in the process. After that, wolves were about to eat him, when a man, who turned out to be Gulz·r, killed them and saved him.  Atauko was brought to Carn-D˚m, where he was given the name D˚rmarth by the High Sorcerer of Angmar. From then and onwards, he could not think of anything but his hatred for Arthedain. D˚rmarth became a loyal follower of the Iron Crown, learning to tame Wolves and Trolls (losing his left ring finger in the process). He swore to protect the man who had saved him, and after a while, he ended up becoming the Captain of the Shadow Guard of the Witch-King himself. "

Elladan and Elrohir were born in TA 130, and they have a younger sister, Arwen. Through their mother CelebrÌan, they are the only grandsons of Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn of LothlÛrien. In TA 2509, the brothers rescued their mother from her imprisonment with the Orcs. Although she was physically healed by Elrond, after fear and torment from the Orcs she lost all joy from Middle-earth, and so she departed for the Grey Havens the next year. Due to this, the twins harbored great hatred for Orcs. By the year TA 2933, Elladan and Elrohir went riding against Orcs with Arathorn II, the father of Aragorn. There Arathorn was slain and his wife and son went to dwell in Imladris, where Elrond received Aragorn as his foster-son, naming him Estel."

Elladan and Elrohir were born in TA 130, and they have a younger sister, Arwen. Through their mother CelebrÌan, they are the only grandsons of Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn of LothlÛrien. In TA 2509, the brothers rescued their mother from her imprisonment with the Orcs. Although she was physically healed by Elrond, after fear and torment from the Orcs she lost all joy from Middle-earth, and so she departed for the Grey Havens the next year. Due to this, the twins harbored great hatred for Orcs. By the year TA 2933, Elladan and Elrohir went riding against Orcs with Arathorn II, the father of Aragorn. There Arathorn was slain and his wife and son went to dwell in Imladris, where Elrond received Aragorn as his foster-son, naming him Estel."

His ancestor Arvedui was wedded to FÌriel, who was descended from An·rion, who bore their son Aranarth, making Aragorn the last descendant of An·rion as well. When he was only 2 years old, his father Arathorn was killed while pursuing orcs. Aragorn was afterwards fostered in Rivendell by Elrond. At the request of his mother, his lineage was kept secret, as she feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as the descendant of Elendil and Heir of Isildur became known. Aragorn was renamed Estel and was not told about his heritage until 2951. Elrond revealed to "Estel" his true name and ancestry when he was twenty, and gave to him the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil. Elrond withheld the Sceptre of Ann˙minas from Aragorn until he "came of the right" to possess the item. It was also around this time that Aragorn met and fell in love with Arwen, Elrond's daughter, newly returned from her mother's homeland of LÛrien where she had visited her grandmother Galadriel."

He returned with reinforcements to face Morgomirs' army and his necromancers, however they were also defeated. With his reinforcements dead, he retreated deeper into the land.

Morgoth created trolls before the First Age. They were very strong, but turned into stone in sunlight. Many trolls died in the War of Wrath, but some survived and joined the forces of Sauron, the greatest surviving servant of Morgoth. In the Second and Third Age, trolls were among Sauron's most dangerous warriors. He created the Olog-hai, which were smarter than earlier breeds of trolls. While most trolls cannot bear exposure to sunlight without turning to stone, the Olog-hai apparently could (to the same extent as orcs); this attribute was mentioned in The Return of the King as making them particularly dangerous."

The war Azog started climaxed in the Battle of Azanulbizar, where he killed N·in, but while fleeing back to the gates of Moria he was caught and beheaded by N·in's son D·in. After killing ThrÛr, Azog had given a small pouch of money to ThrÛr's companion, as payment for him to tell the other Dwarves of the murder. The Dwarves returned the insult by setting Azog's severed head on a stake and sticking the money pouch in his mouth."

Halbarad accompanied Aragorn to a chamber high in the Hornburg where Aragorn looked into the Palantir and revealed himself to Sauron. That morning Aragorn decided to take the Paths of the Dead, down the Dimholt Road, under the White Mountains and Halbarad and the Grey Company went with him, along with Legolas and Gimli. When they reached the entrance at daybreak on March 8, Halbarad said, "This is an evil door, and my death lies beyond it. I will dare to pass it nonetheless..." At midnight at the Stone of Erech, Aragorn summoned the Dead to fulfill their oaths and Halbarad unfurled Aragorn's standard, which appeared black with no device in the darkness. The Grey Company and the Army of the Dead passed through the lands of the South to Pelargir, where they captured the fleet of the Corsairs. Aragorn dismissed the Dead, and the Grey Company sailed up the Anduin. When they arrived at the Pelennor Fields on March 15 in the midst of the battle, Aragorn's standard was once again unfurled but now it was seen to bear the emblem of the White Tree of Gondor and the 7 Stars and Crown of Elendil. Halbarad carried the standard onto the battlefield, where he was killed."

Although Sauron was still hiding in Dol Guldur (disguised as the Necromancer), the other 8 Nazg˚l rallied around the Witch-king. Together, the 9 of them laboured to rebuild their master's power in Mordor, gathering huge Orcish hordes about themselves. In the year TA 2000 they came out of Mordor and began attacking Gondor, which was recovered from the Great Plague but devastated by the Wainriders. In TA 2002 they captured Minas Ithil, and took the place for their own. It became known as Minas Morgul and its citadel "the Tower of Witchcraft", and remained a place of great evil for centuries thereafter. In TA 2043, King Earnil II of Gondor passed away and his son E‰rnur, the Witch-king's old enemy, inherited the throne. Upon his coronation, the Witch-king challenged him to single combat, but E‰rnur refused. However, 7 years later in TA 2050 the Witch-king again challenged himóand E‰rnur accepted. The Gondorian King rode out of Minas Tirith to fight the Witch-king at Minas Morgul. He entered the city's gates and was never seen again, thus ending the reign of the Gondorian Kings and beginning the rule of the Stewards of Gondor. In TA 2063 the Watchful Peace began when Sauron fled Dol Guldur and hid in the East, and the Nazg˚l remained quiet in Minas Morgul for the next 400 years.""

"Recruit one of the Blue Wizards \n Spell Focus: Elements of the Heavens \n \n Lore: \n Before he came to Middle-earth, Pallando was Maia of OromÎ the Huntsman. He was taken to Middle-earth at the bidding of Alatar, another Istar who took him as a friend. Pallando and Alatar (known as the Blue Wizards for their sea-blue robes) traveled to the east of Middle-earth with Curumo (Saruman the White) to aid some men and subdue others, primarily the Easterlings and Southrons who worshiped Sauron, and whose numbers were steadily increasing. Saruman later returned to the West, but Pallando along with Alatar stayed behind. Other than this, not much is positively known about Pallando or Alatar, but it is thought that Pallando most likely failed his mission eventually. However, in Tolkien's later years he provided an alternate name for the wizard, RÛmest·mo, meaning "helper of the East". Here it is thought that rather than fail his mission altogether, Pallando perhaps had the opposite fate, and he and Alatar may have in fact played some crucial role in the War of the Ring and in the victory of the Army of the West, unnoticed but significant."
END

CONTROLBAR:ToolTipBuildAlatar
"Recruit one of the blue wizards \n Magic: Air \n \n Lore: \n Alatar, also called Morinehtar was a Maia and an immortal Istar wizard. He travelled to Middle-earth in the Second Age with RÛmest·mo (Pallando), and they became the Ithryn Luin, or "Blue Wizards". They travelled to the east of Arda, to countries in far eastern Middle-earth such as Rh˚n and Khand, where they were sent to stir up rebellions against those serving Sauron. In this, they were successful, and they later returned to Middle-earth in the Third Age and travelled East and South once again, but they never returned to the West after their journey with Saruman. It is possible that they became the founders of secret and magical cults, but their ultimate fate remains unknown."

ThÈodred's mother Elfhild died giving birth to him. During the War of the Ring, Prince ThÈodred was the Second Marshal of Rohan and commanded western Rohan. He set Grimbold in command with fifty dismounted Riders, while ThÈodred himself manned the eyot, to cover Grimbold if he was driven back. Amidst the battle, Elfhelm found Grimbold fighting 2 axemen for ThÈodred's body. ThÈodred was slain by an Orc-man in the First Battle of the Fords of Isen, and his body was defended by the marshal Grimbold. The death of ThÈodred made his cousin …omer the heir to the throne of Rohan. Little else is known about him, except that he loved …omer like a brother, and loved no one more except for ThÈoden."

"Recruit one of the blue wizards \n Kind of magic: Rocks \n \n Lore: \n Before he came to Middle-earth, Pallando was Maia of OromÎ the Huntsman. He was taken to Middle-earth at the bidding of Alatar, another Istar who took him as a friend. Pallando and Alatar (known as the Blue Wizards for their sea-blue robes) traveled to the east of Middle-earth with Curumo (Saruman the White) to aid some men and subdue others, primarily the Easterlings and Southrons who worshiped Sauron, and whose numbers were steadily increasing. Saruman later returned to the West, but Pallando along with Alatar stayed behind. Other than this, not much is positively known about Pallando or Alatar, but it is thought that Pallando most likely failed his mission eventually. However, in Tolkien's later years he provided an alternate name for the wizard, RÛmest·mo, meaning "helper of the East". Here it is thought that rather than fail his mission altogether, Pallando perhaps had the opposite fate, and he and Alatar may have in fact played some crucial role in the War of the Ring and in the victory of the Army of the West, unnoticed but significant."

With the arrival of Glorfindel and Gloin, the Dwarves were able to fight back a multitude of Goblins, Spiders, Trolls, and Fire-drakes.

"Recruit the Lord of Gray Havens \n \n Lore: \n CÌrdan, also known as NowÎ and CÌrdan the Shipwright, was a Telerin Elf (of which he was one of the wisest princes), a great mariner and shipwright in Middle-earth. CÌrdan was the lord of the Falas and then of the Balar during much of the First Age, one of the wisest and perhaps the mightiest of the Moriquendi. He was the bearer of the Great Ring Narya, which he in turn gave to Gandalf. He was kin to both ElwÎ and OlwÎ. He is one of the 3 oldest living elves in Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age, along with Galadriel and Celeborn, who were all born during the Years of the Trees. At the end of the Third Age, there were no other elves who had been alive at the start of the First Age. CÌrdan is one of 2 elves, the other being Celeborn, to have spent the most time in Middle-Earth of any elf by being present in more ages than any other elf. CÌrdan and Celeborn were in Arda from sometime late in the Years of the Trees, through the First Age, until the Fourth Age. Tolkien has written that CÌrdan would sail on the last ship into the West, as he is the Lord of the Grey Havens. So, it can thus be known that CÌrdan had the longest incarnated single life span of any elf, having entered Arda during the Years of the Trees and having left for Valinor later in the Fourth Age than any other Elf"

After the Ring was destroyed, Mount Doom erupted and Frodo and Sam were stranded on a hill amid flowing lava and falling ash. Gandalf asked Gwaihir to bear him a final time.

In the Second and Third Age, trolls were among Sauron's most dangerous warriors. He created the Olog-hai, which were smarter than earlier breeds of trolls. While most trolls cannot bear exposure to sunlight without turning to stone, the Olog-hai apparently could (to the same extent as orcs); this attribute was mentioned in The Return of the King as making them particularly dangerous."

In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thr·in II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death."

ThÈoden, under advice from Gandalf, retreated and fought against Saruman's hordes at the Battle of Helm's Deep. After this, he became known as ThÈoden Ednew, the Renewed, because he had thrown off the yoke of Saruman. He challenged the Witch-king of the 9 Ringwraiths, and was unconscious when his horse Snowmane fell upon him after being spooked by the Ringwraith's fell beast. He was quickly protected by his niece …owyn and the Hobbit Meriadoc Brandybuck both of whom had ridden to war in secret. Theoden's wounds were mortal and he perished on the plains of Pelennor."

When Gandalf the White, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli appeared before him, ThÈoden initially rebuked Gandalf's advice to resist Saruman, but after being released from the effects of GrÌma, he commanded Hama to release his nephew and bring him his sword, and led the Riders of Rohan into battle against Saruman but having found that Saruman's forces had broken through Rohan's outer defenses. ThÈoden, under advice from Gandalf, retreated and fought against Saruman's hordes at the Battle of Helm's Deep. After this, he became known as ThÈoden Ednew, the Renewed, because he had thrown off the yoke of Saruman. He challenged the Witch-king of the 9 Ringwraiths, and was unconscious when his horse Snowmane fell upon him after being spooked by the Ringwraith's fell beast. He was quickly protected by his niece …owyn and the Hobbit Meriadoc Brandybuck both of whom had ridden to war in secret. Theoden's wounds were mortal and he perished on the plains of Pelennor."

"Recruit the brave companion of the Shire. \n \n Lore: \n Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck (later known as Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck I, due to his grandson's birth) was a Hobbit and one of Frodo's cousins and closest friends. He loved boats and ponies and had a great interest in the maps of Middle-earth. He was also one of the 9 companions of the Fellowship of the Ring, and later became the eighth Master of Buckland. Merry was often considered the most perceptive and intelligent of the hobbits, for example, knowing of the One Ring and its power even before Frodo Baggins left the Shire. He guarded Bag End after Bilbo's party, protecting Frodo from the various and often unwanted guests. He also was the force behind "the Conspiracy" of Sam, Pippin, Fredegar Bolger (more commonly known as "Fatty", due to his plump form) and himself to help Frodo. Thus, even before the Quest of the Ring begins, Merry was well prepared and organized; he assembled their gear and brought ponies. His shortcut through the Old Forest served them well, because they avoided the Black Riders and met Tom Bombadil, who helped them. At the Barrow-downs, Merry acquired his sword, a work of Westernesse.

"Recruit the Lord of the Spiders \n \n Lore: \n Gorkil was a powerful Goblin ruler during the Third Age. He is portrayed as a goblin riding on the back of a Giant Scorpion. He appears to be the King of all the Goblin tribes. He and his armies took control of the abandoned outpost in the Ettenmoors in Angmar, formerly owned by the Witch-king of Angmar. Sauron uses Gorkil to control the goblins and serve his will. He also owns and raised a rare, gigantic scorpion. Gorkil was killed at the Ettenmoors by Glorfindel of Rivendell, Haldir of LothlÛrien, and Gloin, father of Gimli. When he died, his goblins were lost and confused and Sauron's hold over them was broken."

Durin was set to sleep alone beneath Mount Gundabad in Middle-earth until the Elves awoke. Upon his awakening at Mount Gundabad in the Years of the Trees, he traveled until he came upon the Mirrormere, the lake that the Dwarves call Kheled-z‚ram. He created there a great city within the Misty Mountains. This was Khazad-d˚m, known by Elves as Moria. According to the Dwarves, Durin awoke at Mount Gundabad in the north of the Misty Mountains, which remained a sacred place to them ever after. Durin and his heirs were revered by all Dwarves, and not just those of his own line. Durin founded the line of Dwarves called Durin's Folk. Durin was called the Deathless because he lived far longer than any other known dwarf. It was also believed that Durin would be reincarnated a total of 6 times, each time as a descendant of an older Durin. Later, while passing through Moria with the Fellowship, Gimli sang a poem about Durin."

"Gamling \n \n Lore: \n Gamling was a Man of Rohan sometimes known as "Gamling the Old" referenced in The 2 Towers and the Return of the King. Gamling was from the Westfold and he understood the language of Dunland. Gamling is left in charge of the forces defending Helm's Dike (a fortification across the Deeping-coomb before the stronghold of the Hornburg defending Helm's Deep) by command of Erkenbrand. King ThÈoden of Rohan arrives at Helm's Deep with reinforcements from Edoras on March 3, 3019. As the forces of Isengard approach, Gamling and his men pull back from Helm's Dike and enter the stronghold of the Hornburg. Gamling hears Gimli's warning that Orcs have entered a culvert under the wall and leads the Men of the Westfold in a charge that drives them back. Gamling then asks Gimli to help block up the opening with small boulders and broken stones with the remark, "We must stop this rat-hole. Dwarves are said to be cunning folk with stone. Lend us your aid, master!" However, Saruman's forces later breach the Deeping Wall using an explosive device. Gamling retreats into the Deep with Gimli. There they defend the narrows before the entrance to the Glittering Caves until dawn, when Gandalf and Eomer arrive with reinforcements, and the Battle of the Hornburg is won."

CONTROLBAR:HaldirRecruit
"Recruit the agile defender of LothlÛrien \n \n Lore: \n Haldir was an Elf of LothlÛrien, probably a Silvan Elf, and a marchwarden who guarded the forest's northern borders. When the Fellowship of the Ring arrived in LÛrien, he became their guide to Caras Galadhon. He and his companions are described as wearing grey hooded cloaks and residing on platforms or flets. Haldir was accompanied by his brothers, R˙mil and Orophin, who interacted little with the Fellowship because they, unlike Haldir, spoke little of the Common Tongue. Haldir could speak it fluently, as he often travelled outside of LothlÛrien. Little is known about his brothers."

"Recruit the leader of Imladris \n Silmaril Hero \n Silmaril function: Elrond takes the Silmaril to bring him to the Valar \n \n Lore: \n Elrond (Sindarin; IPA: "Star-Dome") Half-elven, Lord of Rivendell, was one of the mighty Elf-rulers of old who lived in Middle-earth from the First Age to the beginning of the Fourth Age. He was the father of Arwen Undomiel, lover of Aragorn II Elessar. Elrond Half-elven is the son of Earendil and Elwing, and a great-grandson of L˙thien. He was born in the refuge of the Havens of Sirion in Beleriand late in the First Age, soon before its sack by the Sons of FÎanor. Elrond and his twin brother Elros were captured and raised by Maglor a Son of FÎanor. Though at first there was no great love between them, eventually Maglor took pity on them and cherished them, and eventually grew to love them. By the end of the First Age and the War of Wrath, the Sons of FÎanor were again working alone, suggesting that by this time Elrond and Elros had left their nominal captivity and traveled to Lindon."

In marrying Aragorn II Elessar after the War of the Ring, she became Queen of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor, and like Beren and L˙thien before her, she united Elf and Man in peaceful love and harmony, in the process becoming mortal. Arwen was born in TA 241, to Lord Elrond and Lady CelebrÌan of Rivendell. Like her father and brothers, she had the right to choose between immortality or mortal life. She lived most of her life in Rivendell and LothlÛrien interchangeably. In the year 121 of the Fourth Age, after Aragorn's death, Arwen died of a broken heart at Cerin Amroth in LÛrien, and was buried there one year after the death of Aragorn, to whom she had been wedded for 122 years. She was 2901 years old."

"Recruit the spy of Saruman \n \n Lore: \n GrÌma Wormtongue was the chief advisor to King ThÈoden of Rohan before being exposed as an agent and spy of Saruman. He ends up being the killer of Saruman, in the last climactic chapter of The Return of the King. Little is known of GrÌma before he became counselor of ThÈoden in Edoras. His childhood is a mystery. What is known is that GrÌma, son of G·lmÛd, and a native of Rohan, joined the service of Saruman in secret and worked as a spy to weaken ThÈoden and his kingdom, using his voice to keep the spell intact while Saruman is inside the King. It is likely that Saruman had promised him …owyn, the king's niece, as a reward for his services; in the novel, Wormtongue is accused of "watching her under his lids and haunting her steps" and in the film, he makes clumsy romantic overtures to her as she weeps for her dead cousin ThÈodred. He also exiles …owyn's brother …omer and his army from Rohan, only saying that he sees "too much" after …omer says, "Too long have you watched my sister, too long have you haunted her steps". It is also possible that he has Dunlending ancestry, since he is darker-haired and physically smaller than the other Rohirrim."

"Recruit the son of Argeleb, the guardian of Amon Sul. \n \n Lore: \n Arveleg I was the eighth King of Arthedain. The beginning and the end of the Arveleg's reign were forged in battle and in war. He came to the throne in TA 1356 when his father Argeleb I went to war against the newly allied lands of Rhudaur and Angmar, and was slain. Arveleg swiftly struck back with the combined forces of the Men of Cardolan and the Elves of Lindon and drove back the invading hordes for a time. For more than fifty years, Arveleg maintained a constant guard stretching from the Weather Hills, along the Great East Road, to the lower reaches of the river Hoarwell. Due in large to the defensive prowess of the Men of Arthedain and Cardolan, Angmar was temporarily pushed back and besieged Rivendell."

"Recruit the King of Arthedain \n \n Lore: \n Argeleb I was the seventh King of Arthedain. Argeleb succeeded his father Malvegil in TA 1349 when he died, because the line of kings of the D˙nedain of the North had failed in the realms of Cardolan and Rhudaur. Argeleb claimed the Kingship of all of Arnor again, taking the royal prefix ar(a)- as a sign. He was thus not only the seventh King of Arthedain, but also the seventeenth King of Arnor. Cardolan accepted this rule, but it was too late for Rhudaur as it had by then fallen under the control of Angmar, and therefore resisted his rule. As a result of this breach, war broke out between the two opposing sides. Argeleb fortified the hills at Weathertop, and was killed in TA 1356 by evil men from Rhudaur, under the command of the Witch-king of Angmar."

"Recruit the ruler of Angmar \n Silmaril Hero \n Silmaril function: The Witch-king of Angmar nourishes his power and covers the land with cold and ice \n \n Lore: \n The Witch-king of Angmar was the leader of the Nazg˚l or Ringwraiths, and Sauron's second-in-command during the Second and Third Ages. Once a N˙menÛrean king of men, he was corrupted by one of the 9 Rings of Power that had been given to the lords of men, and became an undead wraith in the service of Sauron. Soon, the only resistance against the Witch-king's forces was the western kingdom of Arthedain. The Witch-king continued his war for hundreds of years. In TA 1636, the Witch-king sent wights to the Barrow-downs in Cardolan in order to prevent the rebirth of the kingdom. The Witch-king claimed ultimate victory in the north in TA 1974, when his forces captured Fornost Erain, the capital of Arthedain. With its capture, the final kingdom collapsed, and with it, the last remnants of the lost realm of Arnor were destroyed. The Witch-king gladly took his seat of power in the newly captured Fornost. But his glory did not last long, for in TA 1975, general E‰rnur of Gondor landed at the harbours of the Grey Havens, leading an army of Gondor. His army was joined by the Elves of Lindon and the remnant of the northern D˙nedain, and they marched on the Witch-king."

He has gained this position through ruthless ambition, eliminating all who stood in his way and proving his cunning and strength to the Witch-king. In return, he has received great authority among the Men of Carn D˚m and has even been tutored in dark sorcery - though not nearly to the same extent as the High Sorcerer Gulz·r and the fanatically loyal Zaphragor. The Witch-king knows well that while he is a great asset, he is not truly loyal to anyone and is best kept on a short leash. For his part, Mornamarth burns to rule Angmar himself one day, but for now he bides his time and builds his power by destroying Angmar's enemies.

He was born in Valinor, the only child of FinwÎ, High King of the —oldor, and FinwÎ's first wife MÌriel TherindÎ. He was a craftsman, gem-smith, and warrior, the maker of the Silmarils and inventor of the Tengwar script. He was also the creator of the 7 PalantÌri. He was made the mightiest in all parts of body and mind; of beauty, understanding, skill, and subtlety, of all the Children of Il˙vatar. However, his personality was riddled with flaws, foremost among them selfishness and pride, that ultimately led to him causing his people untold anguish. FÎanor was possibly the strongest Elf that ever lived even surpassing Fingolfin and possibly Galadriel, he even contended with Gothmog (The greatest Balrog to have ever lived) on relative equal terms but was ultimately defeated and killed."

Turgon joined the Union of Maedhros with a 10 thousand strong army and fought alongside his brother Fingon in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, but the sacrifice of H˙rin, Huor, and the Third House of the Edain enabled him to retreat without revealing the location of Gondolin. When Tuor came to Gondolin in FA 496, Turgon welcomed him, but in his pride, he refused to follow the advice of Ulmo to flee to the Havens of Sirion. Now the full malice of Morgoth was directed toward Turgon, last of the House of FinwÎ to control a realm in Middle-earth.

His nobility and death saving Beren and his opposition to the Oath of FÎanor allowed for his return to life in Valinor, making him the first Elf to be reincarnated in the Undying Lands before the end of First Age. Finrod was friendly with Turgon and the House of Fingolfin. He opposed FÎanor and the Oath when he sought to return to Middle-earth to recover the Silmarils from Morgoth, but chose not to be parted with his friends and so he followed his father and his House and the House of Fingolfin. Finrod did not fight in the Kinslaying of AlqualondÎ nor was he aware of it as he continued the transit through Araman. While marching up the coast, the host encountered a figure on a rock and heard the Prophecy of the North.

His rule was plagued by war with the Dunlendings that attempted to usurp his rule of Rohan. Helm was born in TA 2691 and was the son of Gram. He became King at the age of fifty when his father Gram died in TA 2741 during a time of crisis. His father had fought open warfare with the Dunlendings, who operated from the captured fortress of Isengard. During his reign, King Helm came into conflict with an arrogant, wealthy, and powerful landowner named Freca. Freca was a Dunlending with Rohirric blood; he claimed to be a descendant of King FrÈawine of Rohan. Freca held lands - both banks of the river Adorn and his stronghold was near its source on the borders of Rohan. Freca viewed King Helm with both contempt and scorn, while Helm mistrusted Freca and was wary of him. In TA 2754, Freca attempted to intimidate and coerce King Helm into giving his approval and consent to an arranged marriage between Freca's son Wulf and Helm's daughter. Freca marched to a meeting of the King's council in Edoras with a great force of men, planning to threaten the King into complying with his demands. In the resulting quarrel, Helm Hammerhand smote Freca with single blow from his fist. The blow was so great Freca died soon after. Enraged, the men of Freca left Edoras, and King Helm declared Wulf and his kin enemies of the King."

"Recruit one of the greatest of the Long-worms that infested the Grey Mountains in the north of Middle-earth. \n \n Lore: \n Of his life, little is known. However it is possible that Scatha was a remnant of the dragons of Morgoth that fled into Northeast after the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age. It is not certain whether Scatha was the dragon which killed Dain I and his son FrÛr. The death of Scatha at the hands of Fram, He appeared in the Third Age, and his lair was in the southern slopes of the Grey Mountains. He greatly troubled the Dwarves and Men living in the lands North of the Wilderland and had stolen a great deal of their treasure. He was slain by the …othÈod leader Fram, son of Frumgar (an ancestor of Eorl the Young) in the early days of the …othÈod (roughly TA 2000). After Scatha's demise, peace came to the land save for a dispute over his stolen treasure. In his hoard was found a silver horn, the Horn of Rohan later given to Meriadoc Brandybuck by …owyn. The Dwarves also claimed the horn (partially justified as the Horn of Rohan was said to be Dwarven make) but Fram would not give them anything. Instead, Fram sent them a necklace made out of Scatha's teeth. The Dwarves were insulted and may have slain him and took what they wanted."

"Angband was a large terrible place built into Thangorodrim \n Before the Great Gate, there was a sombre court area flanked by frightening cliffs \n and walled by great towers of a great battlement. \n Through the gate, there was a long great tunnel leading to a 'labyrinthine pyramid' \n of stairs to corridors, tunnels, smithy chambers which a tall chimney went up through the mountain to the smokey \n towers of Thangorodrim that spewed poisonous fumes for hundreds of years. \n There were also many tunnels leading to the slave quarters or vaults. \n All tunnels of course led to Morgoth's throne in the Nethermost Hall."

He lived during the First Age of the Sun in Middle-earth, and was a lord of the hidden Elven kingdom of Gondolin. He became infamous for his betrayal of the location of the city of Gondolin to the Dark Lord Morgoth. Aredhel had left Gondolin to wander through Beleriand, and in the woods of Nan Elmoth, she met Eol, and stayed with him, eventually giving birth to Maeglin. Eol gave his child the name Maeglin when he was 12. His mother told him about Gondolin and its people throughout his childhood and he desired to see his related kin in the Hidden City. He and his mother soon grew weary and discontented with their life in Nan Elmoth and Eol's strict shunning of the outside world. When Aredhel finally decided to leave Eol, she took her son (who stole his father's sword, Anguirel, forged of meteoric iron) with her and returned to Gondolin. However, Eol had followed her, and in judgment before Turgon, he attempted to kill Maeglin with a poisoned dart, but hit Aredhel instead. She died, and Eol was cast down to his death from the city walls."

This throne scene, with its triple invocation of holiness (a formula that came to be known as the Trisagion), profoundly influenced subsequent theology, literature and art. Its influence is frequently seen in works depicting angels, heaven and apotheosis.

He was a noble with Dunlending and Rohirric blood, who held lands at either side of the river Adorn, the border of Rohan, and claimed to be a descendant of King FrÈawine of Rohan. Obtaining wealth and power from his rich domain, he constructed a stronghold at the source of the Adorn and paid little heed to the king although Helm called upon him to attend his councils."
