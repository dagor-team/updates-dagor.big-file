General Changes:
-Builders should now resist enemy hero hits with ease, in order to kill builders players are expected to attack them with regular units,siege or powers.
IMPORTANT STUFF HERE**** 
-Upon discovery that any kind of elemental resistance is actually 100% INVULNERABILITY to the element listed we are releasing a hotfix giving split damage to many abilities and weapons that didnt have it before.
-We will fix this properly in the future but will require to so much more work than the older and wrong implementation.For noow text will be changed as much as posible, but if you see any text listing 15%, 50% magioc resistance or frost or element... its actually total inmmunity.
